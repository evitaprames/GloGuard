            <h2>Types of Skin Diseases</h2>
            <p>
                At GloGuard, we are committed to providing information about various skin diseases to empower individuals to 
                take control of their skin health. Here are six common types of skin diseases:
            </p>

            <h3>Seborrheic Keratosis</h3>
            <p>
                Seborrheic keratosis is a non-cancerous skin growth that appears as a brown, black, or pale growth on the skin's 
                surface. It is usually found on areas exposed to the sun, such as the face, chest, back, and neck.
            </p>

            <h3>Actinic Keratosis</h3>
            <p>
                Actinic keratosis, also known as solar keratosis, is a rough, scaly patch on the skin caused by years of sun exposure. 
                It can vary in color and is often found on areas frequently exposed to the sun, like the face, ears, and hands.
            </p>

            <h3>Basal Cell Carcinoma</h3>
            <p>
                Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that usually appears as a waxy bump or a flat, flesh-colored or brown 
                scar-like lesion. It is the most common form of skin cancer and often occurs on sun-exposed areas.
            </p>

            <h3>Dermatofibroma</h3>
            <p>
                Dermatofibroma is a benign skin nodule that often appears on the lower legs. It is typically red or brown and may 
                feel like a small hard lump under the skin.
            </p>

            <h3>Melanoma</h3>
            <p>
                Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops from melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells of the skin. It can 
                appear as a new mole or an existing mole that changes in size, shape, or color.
            </p>

            <h3>Vascular Lesion</h3>
            <p>
                Vascular lesions are abnormalities of blood vessels in the skin. They can manifest as birthmarks, hemangiomas, or 
                port-wine stains, and may be red, purple, or pink in color.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is essential to consult a dermatologist if you notice any unusual changes in your skin's appearance or if you have 
                concerns about potential skin diseases. Early detection and proper treatment are crucial for maintaining healthy skin.
